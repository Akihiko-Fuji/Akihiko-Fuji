I have **designed, developed, and operated** various **factory digital transformation** systems including:  <BR>  
   - **MES systems** I developed end-to-end, covering **concept planning, system design, hardware evaluation, coding, deployment, and ongoing maintenance**, to collect **work performance data from human operators**, rather than just machines. 📊
   - I'm a member of [ENAA Smart Factory Research Group](https://www.enaa.or.jp/research/smart).
   - **Work instruction printing systems**, which I optimized for **work efficiency and material minimization** using **operations research** principles. 🖨️  
   - **Error prevention systems** I developed to prevent **human errors in material usage and work procedures** in factory operations. ⚙️  
   - **Warehouse management systems** I built, utilizing **RFID or QR codes** for efficient tracking and inventory control. 📦
   - **Streamlit** I have started graphing our data using Streamlit.📈📊
   - **Order support tools**📃
   - **WordPress-based** employee community services & custom web-based tools, and I build systems for Redmine, a project management web application, and Zabbix, a network management tool🌐 and some et cetera systems.

### 🏗️ **Building & Construction**  
 Involved in **administrative coordination**, **legal compliance**, and **project management** in architecture.  

### 🎨 **Product Design**  
 One of my designed products **won the prestigious Good Design Award** in Japan.  

### 🧪 **Chemistry**  
 Studied **applied chemistry** in college, focusing on the **synthesis of carbon nanotubes**.  

### 🐍 **Python & Tech Exploration**

## 🎯 Current Projects  
I'm currently working on **developing unique and original tools with Python**, aiming to create **practical solutions that haven’t been done before**.  

### 📌 **Ongoing Projects**  
#### 🗨️ SSD1309 RRS Reader 
RSS news reader for Raspberry Pi and SSD1309 and SSD1306 OLED display with Japanese display support. It also supports article/feed switching by button operation and automatic scrolling display.

🔗 **GitHub:**  [SSD1309 RRS Reader](https://github.com/Akihiko-Fuji/SSD1306RRS_reader)

#### 🔍 Clipboard Scouter  
An OCR tool designed for **capturing and processing on-screen text**. Unlike traditional OCR software that scans printed materials, this tool extracts text from **screenshots, error messages, and online presentations**. Perfect for **copying unselectable text** from web conferences or troubleshooting errors!  

🔗 **GitHub:** [Clipboard Scouter](https://github.com/Akihiko-Fuji/scouter)  

#### 🔠 Serial to Keyboard (ser2key)  
A tool for **converting serial input (e.g., barcode scanner data) into keystrokes**. Designed to **improve character recognition accuracy and speed**, especially for **Japanese QR code data** containing half-width kana or kanji. Works with **RS-232C, USB, and Bluetooth SPP** devices.  

🔗 **GitHub:** [Serial to Keyboard (ser2key)](https://github.com/Akihiko-Fuji/ser2key)  

#### 🗨️ Genuine OCR Optimizer 3 (Gocro3)  
High Performance, High Precision **PDF OCR Tool Project** Overview This project is a powerful tool that uses Python to extract characters contained in PDF files using optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert standard PDF documents into PDFs with searchable text. It is especially designed for mixed Japanese and English documents and provides a variety of preprocessing options to achieve highly accurate and efficient text recognition.

🔗 **GitHub:** [Genuine OCR Optimizer 3 (Gocro3)](https://github.com/Akihiko-Fuji/gocro3)  

#### 🗨️ Quality Relationship Assurance (QR-Assure)  
This program is a system that reads QR codes, matches each QR code, and logs the results.

1. reads QR Codes, each of which has a different number of digits, as a partial match for the value contained in either one.
2. extracts the data of the read QR Code.
3. Notifies the user of the match or mismatch by LED and buzzer based on the collation results.
4. Records the collation results in a log file (CSV format).

## 📸 About Me  
**Photograph** has been my passion for nearly 30 years. 📷  
I’ve held **solo exhibitions** and have done **self-Developing and Printing Enlarging (DPE)** in my home darkroom. 🖼️  

### 🔍 **Lens & Camera Enthusiast**
 I’m fascinated by **cameras and lenses** and love experimenting with them!  
 Especially interested in **industrial lenses**, including:  
   - **X-ray photography lenses**  
   - **Oscilloscope lenses**  
   - **High-speed camera lenses**  
   - **Cinema lenses** 🎬  
   - **Industrial line scan lenses**  
   - **Projector lenses**  
   - **Enlarging lenses**  

📌 These lenses do not have the useful feature of autofocus. On the contrary, **they do not have focus rings, or aperture control**, but I enjoy the challenge of shooting with them! 🎞️  

### 🛠️ **Make & Build**
I love working with my hands and have a well-equipped workshop at home. I regularly engage in hands-on projects involving:

Spray painting booth 🎨<BR>
Milling machine for cutting metals 🔩<BR>
Stationary soldering station for precision work 🔧<BR>
Various other machining tools<BR>
These tools help me enjoy building and making various projects as part of my creative process.<BR>
