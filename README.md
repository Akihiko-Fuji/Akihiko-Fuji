Hi there, I'm Akihiko Fujita. ðŸ‘‹
I'm not a professional programmer, but I have a passion for system design and coding.<br>
I enjoy creating useful tools and sharing them with others.<br>
Although I am still learning, I aim to contribute with unique and practical solutions!<br>


ðŸ”§ Skills & Expertise
System Design & Engineering: Experienced in mechanical design, factory process design, and improvements.
Roll-to-Roll Equipment: Specialized in roll-to-roll processing.
Building & Construction: Involved in administrative coordination, legal compliance, and project management in architecture.
Python: Currently working with Python for creating tools and solutions, though I'm not a professional developer.
Exploring Technologies: I like to experiment with various technologies and learning new skills outside of coding.
ðŸŽ¯ Current Projects
Iâ€™m working on developing unique, original tools with Python. My goal is to create something that hasn't been done before, offering solutions to real-world problems. Iâ€™m excited to share these projects as I develop them.

ðŸ“¸ About Me
Photography has been my passion for nearly 28 years. Iâ€™ve held solo exhibitions and have done self-processing and printing in my home darkroom. Beyond photography, I am equally fascinated by cameras and lenses and enjoy experimenting with them.
