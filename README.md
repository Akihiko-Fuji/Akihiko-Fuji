Hi there, I'm Akihiko Fujita. ðŸ‘‹
I'm not a professional programmer, but I have a passion for system design and coding.<br>
I enjoy creating useful tools and sharing them with others.<br>
Although I am still learning, I aim to contribute with unique and practical solutions!<br>
<br>

ðŸ”§ **Skills & Expertise**<br>
**Systems design and engineering:** Machinery and equipment installation, especially experienced in roll-to-roll equipment,  process design, and operation improvement.<br>
**Building & Construction:** Involved in administrative coordination, legal compliance, and project management in architecture.<br>
**Python:** Currently working with Python for creating tools and solutions, though I'm not a professional developer.<br>
**Exploring Technologies:** I like to experiment with various technologies and learning new skills outside of coding.<br>

<br>
ðŸŽ¯ **Current Projects**<br>
Iâ€™m working on developing unique, original tools with Python. My goal is to create something that hasn't been done before, offering solutions to real-world problems. Iâ€™m excited to share these projects as I develop them.<br>

<br>
ðŸ“¸ **About Me**<br>
Photography has been my passion for nearly 28 years. Iâ€™ve held solo exhibitions and have done self-processing and printing in my home darkroom. Beyond photography, I am equally fascinated by cameras and lenses and enjoy experimenting with them.<br>
