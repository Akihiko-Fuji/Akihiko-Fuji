## 🔧 Skills & Expertise  
### 🏭 **Systems Design and Engineering**  
Experienced in **production equipment selection**, **machinery installation**, and **line builds**, especially in **roll-to-roll equipment**.  <BR>
Involved in **process design**, **operation improvements**, and **the full lifecycle** from **system design to implementation**.  <BR>

I have **designed, developed, and operated** various **factory digital transformation** systems, including:  <BR>  
   - **MES systems** I designed to collect **work performance data from human operators**, rather than just machines. 📊  
   - **Work instruction printing systems**, which I optimized for **work efficiency and material minimization** using **operations research** principles. 🖨️  
   - **Error prevention systems** I developed to prevent **human errors in material usage and work procedures** in factory operations. ⚙️  
   - **Warehouse management systems** I built, utilizing **RFID or QR codes** for efficient tracking and inventory control. 📦  
   - **Order support tools**📃
   - **WordPress-based** employee community services & custom web-based tools 🌐  


### 🏗️ **Building & Construction**  
 Involved in **administrative coordination**, **legal compliance**, and **project management** in architecture.  

### 🎨 **Product Design**  
 One of my designed products **won the prestigious Good Design Award** in Japan.  

### 🧪 **Chemistry**  
 Studied **applied chemistry** in college, focusing on the **synthesis of carbon nanotubes**.  

### 🐍 **Python & Tech Exploration**  
 Using **Python** to develop original tools and solutions.   <BR>
 Love experimenting with **new technologies** and exploring fields beyond programming.   <BR>

## 🎯 Current Projects  
I'm currently working on **developing unique and original tools with Python**, aiming to create **practical solutions that haven’t been done before**.  

### 📌 **Ongoing Projects**  
#### 🔍 Clipboard Scouter  
An OCR tool designed for **capturing and processing on-screen text**. Unlike traditional OCR software that scans printed materials, this tool extracts text from **screenshots, error messages, and online presentations**. Perfect for **copying unselectable text** from web conferences or troubleshooting errors!  

🔗 **GitHub:** [Clipboard Scouter](https://github.com/Akihiko-Fuji/scouter)  

#### 🔠 Serial to Keyboard (ser2key)  
A tool for **converting serial input (e.g., barcode scanner data) into keystrokes**. Designed to **improve character recognition accuracy and speed**, especially for **Japanese QR code data** containing half-width kana or kanji. Works with **RS-232C, USB, and Bluetooth SPP** devices.

## 📸 About Me  
**Photograph** has been my passion for nearly 30 years. 📷  
I’ve held **solo exhibitions** and have done **self-developing and printing enlarging(DPE)** in my home darkroom. 🖼️  

### 🔍 Lens & Camera Enthusiast  
 I’m fascinated by **cameras and lenses** and love experimenting with them!  
 Especially interested in **industrial lenses**, including:  
   - **X-ray photography lenses**  
   - **Oscilloscope lenses**  
   - **High-speed camera lenses**  
   - **Cinema lenses** 🎬  
   - **Industrial line scan lenses**  
   - **Projector lenses**  
   - **Enlarging lenses**  

📌 These lenses do not have the useful feature of autofocus. On the contrary, **they do not have focus rings, or aperture control**, but I enjoy the challenge of shooting with them! 🎞️
