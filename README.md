Hi there, I'm Akihiko Fujita. ðŸ‘‹
I'm not a professional programmer, but I have a passion for system design and coding.<br>
I enjoy creating useful tools and sharing them with others.<br>
Although I am still learning, I aim to contribute with unique and practical solutions!<br>
<br>

ðŸ”§ Skills & Expertise<br>
**Systems Design and Engineering:** I have experience in production equipment selection, machinery installation, and line builds, especially in roll-to-roll equipment. Iâ€™ve also been involved in process design, operation improvements, and the entire lifecycle from system design to implementation.
Specifically, I have designed and contributed to the operation of MES systems to gather work performance data, systems to print work instructions, production systems to control errors in factory operations, and warehouse management systems, including coding and operational design.
I specialize in the area of digital transformation of factories.<br>
**Building & Construction:** Involved in administrative coordination, legal compliance, and project management in architecture.<br>
**Product Design:** Iâ€™ve worked on designing products, one of which won the prestigious Good Design Award in Japan.<br>
**Chemistry:** My major in college was applied chemistry, where I investigated the synthesis of carbon nanotubes.<br>
**Python:** Currently working with Python for creating tools and solutions, though I'm not a professional developer.<br>
**Exploring Technologies:** I like to experiment with various technologies and learning new skills outside of coding.<br>

<br>
ðŸŽ¯ Current Projects <br>
Iâ€™m working on developing unique, original tools with Python.<br>
My goal is to create something that hasn't been done before, offering solutions to real-world problems.<br>
Iâ€™m excited to share these projects as I develop them.<br>

<br>
ðŸ“¸ About Me<br>
Photography has been my passion for nearly 28 years.<br>
Iâ€™ve held solo exhibitions and have done self-processing and printing in my home darkroom.<br><br>

Outside of photography, he is fascinated by cameras and lenses and enjoys experimenting with them.<br>
Industrial lenses; lenses for X-ray photography, for oscilloscopes, for high-speed cameras, for cinemas, for industrial line image scan, for enlareging, and for projectors.<br>
That do not have autofocus, many of which do not have a focus function and an aperture to control light, I like to shoot with lenses that do not have autofocus, a focus function, and an aperture to control light.
